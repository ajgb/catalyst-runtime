Known Bugs:

   - Bug ->go or ->visit causes actions which have Args or CaptureArgs caled
     twice when called via ->go or ->visit.

     Test app: http://github.com/bobtfish/catalyst-app-bug-go_chain/tree/master


   - Certain errors in your application to do with using other code which does
     not exist can cause an 'Unknown error' issue.

     Test app: http://github.com/bobtfish/catalyst-app-bug-unknown-error/tree/master
     < rafl> 21:13:03 < vincent> hah, Class::MOP::Method::Generated->_eval_closure
     < rafl> 21:13:40 < vincent> right, shove a local $@ in there
     < rafl> i can do that and add tests in an hour or two


   - -restarter.t will fail if you don't have ::StashChange installed, and
      also quite often at other times.


   - Catalyst::Test - bugs with Moosification (Khisanth/kane)

Compatibility warnings to add:

   - $self->config should warn as config should only ever be called as a
     class method.

Proposed functionality / feature additions:

    - Log setup needs to be less lame, so Catalyst::Plugin::Log::* can die
      in a fire. Having $c->log_class would be a good start.

      Simple example: Catalyst::Plugin::Log::Colorful should just be a
      subclass of Catalyst::Log, no ::Plugin:: needed.
