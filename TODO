Pending patches:
  - meta test for MX::Emulate::CAF needed by Catalyst::Plugin::Cache::Curried

  - Adopt::NEXT
     - updated docs with how to disable it (t0m/rafl)

Back-compat investigation / konwon issues:

  - Find out why C::P::A's test suite causes the 'stack' attributes
    default method to not be called. (new not being run??)

  - Common engine test failures, look into and get tests into core.

  - CatalystX-Imports, Class::MOP doesn't consider anon subs in the symbol 
    table as methods, tests + fix, or explanation and documentation?
    (rafl & phaylon)

  - Run another round of repository smokes against latest 5.80 trunk, manually
    go through all the things which are broken (t0m).

  - Issues with TWMC not being loaded when it used to be in 5.70 
    (Bill Moseley)

  - Fix memory leaks (I already tried Devel::Leak::Object, but no joy).


Cleanups:

  - Catalyst-Plugin-Authorization-ACL, Can't locate object method "tree" 
    via package "Catalyst::Dispatcher", fix the plugin as tree was never 
    a public method.

  - Catalyst-Model-Akismet, incorrectly inherits from 
    Catalyst::Component::InstancePerContext, should compose as a role. 
    Fix the module.
    
  - Update Test suite to not assume MyApp ISA Controller
    - After that set up attr handlers that will output helpful error messages 
      when you do it as well as how to fix it. (done already?)

  - Comments marked /Moose TODO/i in Catalyst::Request re {_body} (t0m)

  - Eliminate all instances of $instance->{$key}, I think the only thing
    left is lib/Catalyst/Engine/HTTP.pm: $self->{inputbuf}, which I haven't
    touched as it is used as an lvalue in a lot of places (t0m)

  - Find whatever in the test suite craps a file called GLOB(0xfoo) onto my 
    disk and fix it. (Believed to be in the optional tests?) (t0m)

Documentation:

   - extends in components must be inside a BEGIN block.

   - How to write Moosified Catalyst components.

   - Manual / Tutorial updates

   - Fix the Roadmap to be less full of lies.

Profiling:

  - vs 5.70 and optimisation as needed.

Tests:

  - Moosified test application?
