Back-compat investigation:

  - Get engines tested:
    - Catalyst-Engine-Zeus
    - Catalyst-Engine-XMPP2
    - Catalyst-Engine-HTTPEngine
    - Catalyst-Engine-HTTP-Prefork
    - Catalyst-Engine-Wx

Known issues:

     - Catalyst-Log-Log4perl Deep recursion on subroutine "MockApp::setup" due
       to Adopt::NEXT not remembering which setup methods were already called
       and which not, like NEXT does. Log::Log4perl needs to be fixed and the
       problem should be described in Upgrading.pod. (rafl)

     - CatalystX-CRUD and CatalystX-CRUD-ModelAdapter-DBIC
       fail tests against 5.80 (karpet)

     - Catalyst-Plugin-Authorization-ACL fails as 
       Catalyst::Dispatcher::_do_forward does not fix arguments if you throw
       an exception. Needs a test case (Caelum)
     
     - Catalyst::Plugin::Authentication new release.
     
     - Catalyst::Action::RenderView
     - Catalyst::Plugin::DebugCookie
       - Conflict with each other: $c->config->{debug}->{foo} = 'bar'
         now breaks, unsure why..

Cleanups:

  - Find whatever in the test suite craps a file called GLOB(0xfoo) onto my 
    disk and fix it. (Believed to be in the optional TEST_HTTP tests?) (t0m)

Documentation:

   - Manual / Tutorial updates

       - extends in components with attributes must be inside a BEGIN block.

       - How to write Moosified Catalyst components.

   - Catalyst/Upgrading.pod

Reported bugs:

   - Issues with TWMC not being loaded when it used to be in 5.70 
     (Bill Moseley)

Profiling:

  - vs 5.70 and optimisation as needed.

Tests:

  - Moosified test application?
