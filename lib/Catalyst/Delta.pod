=head1 Deltachanges from 5.7 to 5.8

        - Add the Catalyst::Dispatcher->dispatch_type method (ash)
        - Change the $c->visit and $c->go methods to optionally take
          CaptureArgs, making them useful to call ActionChains with (t0m)
        - Added Catalyst::Test::ctx_request to be able to inspect
          the context object after a request is made (Jos Boumans)
        - Add a warning for the old ::[MVC]:: style naming scheme (t0m)
        - Non-naive implementation of making mutable on restart using
          B::Hooks::OP::Check::StashChange if installed (t0m)
For a restart the immutable Moose-objects need to turn back to mutable.
With L<B::Hooks::OP::Check::StashChange> installed this will be done.

        - Add $c->uri_for_action method. (hdp)
A private path to the Catalyst action you want to create a URI for.
This is a shortcut for calling C<< $c->dispatcher->get_action_by_path($path) >>
and passing the resulting C<$action> and the remaining arguments to 
C<< $c->uri_for >>.

        - Use MooseX::MethodAttributes::Inheritable to contain action
          attributes. This means that attributes are now represented in the MOP,
          allowing method modifiers on actions to work as expected. (rafl)
        - Provide a reasonable API in Catalyst::Controller for working with
          and registering actions, allowing a controller sub-class to replace
          subroutine attributes for action declerations with an alternate
          syntax. (rafl/hdp)
        - Disallow writing to config after setup and
          disallow calling setup more than once (rafl)
        - Refactor capturing of $app from Catalyst::Controller into
          Catalyst::Component::ApplicationAttribute for easier reuse in other
          components (Florian Ragwitz)
        - Make MyApp immutable at the end of the scope after the setup
          method is called, fixing issues with plugins which have their 
          own new methods by inlining a constructor on MyApp (t0m)
        - Make log levels additive, and add documentation and tests
          for the setup_log method, which previously had none.
          Sewn together by t0m from two patches provided by David E. Wheeler
        - Switch an around 'new' in Catalyst::Controller to a BUILDARGS
          method as it's much neater and more obvious what is going on (t0m)
        - Use a predicate to avoid recursion in cases where the uri
          method is overridden by a plugin, and calls the base method,
          for example Catalyst::Plugin::SmartURI (t0m)
        - Use Class::C3::Adopt::NEXT (rafl)
Catalyst 5.80 uses L<Algorithm::C3> method dispatch order. This is built into
perl 5.10 (new pragma mro), and comes via L<Class::C3> for perl 5.8. This
replaces L<NEXT> with L<Class::C3::Adopt::NEXT>, forcing all components to
resolve methods using C3, rather than the unpredictable dispatch order of
L<NEXT>. Please "use MRO::Compat" in both perl 5.8 and perl 5.10 to activate
this feature.

        - Fix forwarding to Catalyst::Action objects (Rafael Kitover).
        - Change Catalyst::Test to use Sub::Exporter (Florian Ragwitz).
        - Port to Moose
        - Add Catalyst::Response->print() method (ilmari)
Prints @data to the output stream, separated by $,.  This lets you pass
the response object to functions that want to write to an L<IO::Handle>.

        - Add visit, a returning ->go
In effect, visit allows you to "wrap" another action, just as it
would have been called by dispatching from a URL, while the analogous
go allows you to transfer control to another action as if it had
been reached directly from a URL.
C<< $c->stash >> is kept unchanged.
