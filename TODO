Known issues:

Documentation:

   - Catalyst/Upgrading.pod needs brushing up and C3 linerisation covering.

   - Warning when you pass $c->model("MyApp::Model::Foo") is the generic
     warning for regex fall back. Should be more specific about what you
     screwed up, and the docs for $c->model should be more explicit about
     what is expected. This probably also applies to view/controller.

   - Run more smokes

   - Fix the bleedin visit bug

Profiling:

  - vs 5.70 and optimisation as needed on perl 5.8 (5.10 is already faster!).
