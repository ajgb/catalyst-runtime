Compatibility:
   - Deal with component downwards compatibility in 5.71 (make 5.71 call
     mooses construction logic so that attributes get initialized etc).
   - Provide an extension so that components can have a Moose::Object
     constructor and an @ISA which makes c3 happy on both 5.7X and 5.8X.

   - $self->config should warn as config should only ever be called as a
     class method.

Testing:

   - Run more smokes

Profiling:

  - vs 5.70 and optimisation as needed on perl 5.8 (5.10 is already faster!).
