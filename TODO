Known issues:

     - Catalyst-Log-Log4perl Deep recursion on subroutine "MockApp::setup" due
       to Adopt::NEXT not remembering which setup methods were already called
       and which not, like NEXT does. Log::Log4perl needs to be fixed and the
       problem should be described in Upgrading.pod. (rafl)

     - MX::Emulate::CAF - list assignment (see notes in Upgrading.pod and
       branch in svn)

Documentation:

   - Catalyst/Upgrading.pod needs brushing up

   - Warning when you pass $c->model("MyApp::Model::Foo") is the generic 
     warning for regex fall back. Should be more specific about what you 
     screwed up, and the docs for $c->model should be more explicit about
     what is expected. This probably also applies to view/controller.

Profiling:

  - vs 5.70 and optimisation as needed.
