* improve NEXT warnings. related irc conversation from 09/01/21:

04:41:15 <@mst> actually, even better, it can pass an exclude list
04:41:22 <@mst> and an include list with versions that contain fixage
04:41:39 <@mst> then as shit on CPAN gets fixed it can start warning that you should upgrade
04:41:46 <@rafl> that's already implemented. someone would need to maintain that list though
04:42:28 <@rafl> i still think that silencing the warnings will delay fixes
04:42:33 <@mst> if one person files all the rt tickets
04:42:45 <@mst> it's just a question of watching email
04:44:04 <@mst> and it doesn't seem fair for a user's code to warn all over the fucking place
04:44:10 <@mst> just because some cpan author hasn't got their ass in gear
04:44:52 <@rafl> the user already can disable the warnings for certain classes
04:45:44 <@mst> I think we should leave 'em on for the RCs
04:45:57  * dhoss-laptop phrews
04:46:02 <@mst> but I don't think 5.80 final should be that sqeually
04:46:06 <@rafl> what we have now is basically what i thought was good enough. it can certainly be better.
04:46:17 <@rafl> i won't work on that anytime soon though
04:46:20 <@mst> sure
04:46:34 <@mst> could you throw this conversation into an IDEAS file or something?
