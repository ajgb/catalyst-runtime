Compatibility:
   - Deal with component downwards compatibility in 5.71 (make 5.71 call
     mooses construction logic so that attributes get initialized etc).
   - Provide an extension so that components can have a Moose::Object
     constructor and an @ISA which makes c3 happy on both 5.7X and 5.8X.

Documentation:

   - Warning when you pass $c->model("MyApp::Model::Foo") is the generic
     warning for regex fall back. Should be more specific about what you
     screwed up, and the docs for $c->model should be more explicit about
     what is expected. This probably also applies to view/controller.
     Note: This behavior is also present in 5.71, and so is not a blocker.

   - Run more smokes

Profiling:

  - vs 5.70 and optimisation as needed on perl 5.8 (5.10 is already faster!).
