  - Fix t/caf_backcompat_plugin_accessor_override.t - complex case
    to do with class data / instance data.. Maybe need better tests?
  
  - meta test for MX::Emulate::CAF needed by Catalyst::Plugin::Cache::Curried
    http://code2.0beta.co.uk/moose/svnweb/index.cgi/moose/revision?rev=7036

  - Common engine test failures, look into and get tests into core.

  - Catalyst-Plugin-Authorization-ACL, Can't locate object method "tree" 
    via package "Catalyst::Dispatcher", fix the plugin as tree was never 
    a public method.

  - Catalyst-Model-Akismet, incorrectly inherits from 
    Catalyst::Component::InstancePerContext, should compose as a role. 
    Fix the module.

  - CatalystX-Imports, Class::MOP doesn't consider anon subs in the symbol 
    table as methods, tests + fix, or explanation and documentation?
    (rafl & phaylon)

  - Update Test suite to not assume MyApp ISA Controller
    - After that set up attr handlers that will output helpful error messages 
      when you do it as well as how to fix it. (done already?)
  
  - Comments marked /Moose TODO/i in Catalyst::Request re {_body}
  
  - Eliminate all instances of $instance->{$key}, I think the only thing
    left is lib/Catalyst/Engine/HTTP.pm: $self->{inputbuf}, which I haven't
    touched as it is used as an lvalue in a lot of places.

  - Catalyst-Log-Log4perl - deep recursion in the test suite, investigate 
    (t0m) 

  - Profiling vs 5.70 and optimisation as needed.

  - Fix the Roadmap to be less full of lies.
  
  - Run another round of repository smokes against latest 5.80 trunk, manually
    go through all the things which are broken (t0m).
    
  - Adopt::NEXT
     - New warning message (Bill Moseley)
     - Updated docs with how it works (t0m)
     - provide an env var to just turn the warnings off globally?

   - Issues with TWMC not being loaded when it used to be in 5.70 
     (Bill Moseley)
     
   - Fix memory leaks (I already tried Devel::Leak::Object, but no joy).

   - Find whatever in the test suite craps a file called GLOB(0xfoo) onto my 
     disk and fix it. (Believed to be in the optional tests?)

   - Docsdocsdocs
      - extends in components must be inside a BEGIN block.
      - Moose package loading - document it spits feathers if you don't define 
        any symbols.
        
    - Tests
      - Moosified test application?

    - batman's chained patch / issue?
