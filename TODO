Bugs:
   - Make logging levels properly additive.
   - Stats bugs?
   - Moose tests failing - new MX::MethodAttributes helps with this somewhat.

   - Chained bugs in http://github.com/bobtfish/catalyst-app-bug-go_chain/tree/master

Compatibility:

   - $self->config should warn as config should only ever be called as a
     class method.
