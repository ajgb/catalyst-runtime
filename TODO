  - MooseX::Emulate::Class::Accessor::Fast 
    - Tests for uses of C::A::F from Catalyst repos. - t0m
    - Can't locate object method "mk_accessors" via package "Catalyst::Request::REST"
    - New release once these are done.

  - Look into FormFu test fails, get tests in core (marcus?)

  - Simple test for NEXT compat in core.

  - Common engine test failures, look into and get tests into core.

  - Catalyst-Plugin-Authorization-ACL, Can't locate object method "tree" via package "Catalyst::Dispatcher", fix the plugin as tree was never a public method.

  - Catalyst-Model-Akismet, incorrectly inherits from Catalyst::Component::InstancePerContext, should compose as a role, fix the module.

  - CatalystX-Imports, Class::MOP doesn't consider anon subs in the symbol table as methods, tests + fix?

  - Catalyst::Plugin::Cache::Curried
  - Catalyst::Controller::WrapCGI
    - Both import 'meta' into controller package - mst thinks this can be fixed?.
      but @marcus> and the generated accessors even call $_[0]->meta, so I don't think we can remove it. 
      . Add a test for this in core.
      . Fix core to use CMOP to look up metaclass, rather than ->meta method, and
        namespace::clean the meta method out, fix generated accessors to do the same?

  - Catalyst::Plugin::SmartURI
    - Core tests for behavior which causes it to fail (Caelum)

  - Update Test suite to not assume MyApp ISA Controller
    - After that set up attr handlers that will output helpful error messages when you do it as well as how to fix it. (done already?)
  
  - Comments marked /Moose TODO/i in the code
  
  - Eliminate all instances of $instance->{$key}

  - Catalyst-Log-Log4perl - deep recursion in the test suite, investigate

  - Profiling vs 5.70 and optimisation as needed.

  - http://lists.scsys.co.uk/pipermail/catalyst-dev/2008-November/001546.html
