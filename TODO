Known Bugs:

   - Bug ->go or ->visit causes actions which have Args or CaptureArgs called
     twice when called via ->go or ->visit.

     Test app: http://github.com/bobtfish/catalyst-app-bug-go_chain/tree/master

Compatibility warnings to add:

   - $self->config should warn as config should only ever be called as a
     class method.

Proposed functionality / feature additions:

    - Log setup needs to be less lame, so Catalyst::Plugin::Log::* can die
      in a fire. Having $c->log_class would be a good start. kane volunteered
      to do some of this.

      Simple example: Catalyst::Plugin::Log::Colorful should just be a
      subclass of Catalyst::Log, no ::Plugin:: needed.

  Fixes to component interfaces to deal with anon classes:

22:16 <@mst> t0m: explain what breaks
22:16 <@mst> I'm not 100% sure we have the same problem in mind
22:17 <@t0m> well, various shit in Catalyst utils to resolve app from MyApp::Controller::Foo breaks
22:17 <@mst> Caelum: http://scsys.co.uk:8001/31240
22:17 <@mst> t0m: the trick would be to not need to do that
22:17 <@mst> t0m: $self->_application should be fine
22:18 <@t0m> $action->class can't be fed back into $c->component() 
22:18 <@t0m> which breaks ::REST
22:18 <@mst> right
22:18 <@mst> we need to
22:19 <@mst> (a) add an ->_component_name or similar method to controllers
22:19 <@mst> (b) pass action objects either that or the controller
22:20 <@t0m> do you have a controller calling $action->dispatch? Course you must, the action lives in a controller..
22:21 <@mst> and that doesn't matter anyway
22:21 <@mst> dispatch has $c
22:21 <@mst> it needs to do
22:21 <@mst> $c->component($self->_component_name)
22:21 <@mst> and that _component_name needs to come from the controller at register_actions time
22:22 <@t0m> confound: Oi, please to be releasing my Action::REST fixes, I'm about to do more..
22:22 <@t0m> mst: right, gotcha
22:22 <@mst> note that needs to happen in core
22:22 <@mst> then actions can use that instead of $self->class
22:22 <@mst> and shit will work
