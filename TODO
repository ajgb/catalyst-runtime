Back-compat investigation:

  - Get engines tested:
    - Catalyst-Engine-HTTP-Prefork

Known issues:

     - Catalyst-Log-Log4perl Deep recursion on subroutine "MockApp::setup" due
       to Adopt::NEXT not remembering which setup methods were already called
       and which not, like NEXT does. Log::Log4perl needs to be fixed and the
       problem should be described in Upgrading.pod. (rafl)

     - Waiting on new releases:
       - Catalyst::Plugin::Authentication - 0.100092
       - Catalyst::Action::RenderView     - 0.08
       - Catalyst::Plugin::DebugCookie    - 0.999002
