Compatibility:

   - $self->config should warn as config should only ever be called as a
     class method.

   - Need at least good docs on how C3 fail occurs.

Bugs:

  - Fix the bleedin visit bug

Testing:

   - Run more smokes

Profiling:

  - vs 5.70 and optimisation as needed on perl 5.8 (5.10 is already faster!).
