Back-compat investigation:

  - Get engines tested:
    - Catalyst-Engine-Zeus
    - Catalyst-Engine-XMPP2
    - Catalyst-Engine-HTTPEngine
    - Catalyst-Engine-HTTP-Prefork
    - Catalyst-Engine-SCGI
    - Catalyst-Engine-Wx

Known issues:
     - CatalystX-Imports, Class::MOP doesn't consider anon subs in the symbol 
       table as methods, tests + fix, or explanation and documentation?
       (rafl & phaylon)
 
     - Catalyst-Log-Log4perl Deep recursion on subroutine "MockApp::setup" 
       (rafl)
     
     - Catalyst-Plugin-Cache dies due to mk_accessors('meta')
     
     - CatalystX-CRUD and CatalystX-CRUD-ModelAdapter-DBIC
       fail tests against 5.80 (karpet)

     - Catalyst-Plugin-Authorization-ACL fails as 
       Catalyst::Dispatcher::_do_forward does not fix arguments if you throw
       an exception. Needs a test case (Caelum)
     
     - Catalyst::Plugin::Authentication new release.
     
     - Catalyst::Action::RenderView
     - Catalyst::Plugin::DebugCookie
       - Conflict with each other: $c->config->{debug}->{foo} = 'bar'
         now breaks, unsure why..
         
      - Catalyst::Component::ACCEPT_CONTEXT - Having a COMPONENT method
        after Catalyst::Component::COMPONENT used to work, and will still
        delegate (and warn), but then NEXT::COMPONENT will not dtrt if you
        re-dispatch again (NEXT would seemingly go back to the start?)..
        See Reaction test suite for example of this happening.
        FIXME - Also don't think this correctly delegates - $c appears 
        missing.

  - Fix memory leaks (I already tried Devel::Leak::Object, but no joy).

  -  In 5.70, you can have a component which doesn't inherit from ::Component, 
     and has no new method, and it'll do the right thing for you. We should 
     still support that, but warn for/deprecate it so it can go for 5.9X...
     This obviously needs better tests :/

Cleanups:

  - Allow turning deprecated warnings off with use Catalyst 
    qw/-NoDeprecationWarnings/

  - Update Test suite to not assume MyApp ISA Controller
    - After that set up attr handlers that will output helpful error messages 
      when you do it as well as how to fix it.

  - Eliminate all instances of $instance->{$key}, I think the only thing
    left is lib/Catalyst/Engine/HTTP.pm: $self->{inputbuf}, which I haven't
    touched as it is used as an lvalue in a lot of places (t0m)

  - Find whatever in the test suite craps a file called GLOB(0xfoo) onto my 
    disk and fix it. (Believed to be in the optional TEST_HTTP tests?) (t0m)

Documentation:

   - extends in components with attributes must be inside a BEGIN block.

   - How to write Moosified Catalyst components.

   - Manual / Tutorial updates

   - Fix the Roadmap to be less full of lies.

   -  With 5.7 people did extends qw/Moose::Object Catalyst::Component/, now 
      Catalyst::Component isa Moose::Object so now isa doesn't linearize 
      anymore, docs of what doesn't work and why (rafl)
      
   - Document all other known failure cases / upgrade issues.
   
   - Tidy up / finish off incompatibility warnings etc.

Reported bugs:

   - Issues with TWMC not being loaded when it used to be in 5.70 
     (Bill Moseley)

Profiling:

  - vs 5.70 and optimisation as needed.

Tests:

  - Moosified test application?

  - Test warning from back-compat methods in Catalyst::Dispatcher
  
  - Test warnings from plugin method on Catalyst
