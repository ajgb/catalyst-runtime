=head1 Deltachanges from 5.7 to 5.8

This is an overview of the user visible changes in 5.8

=head2 Deprecations

Please see L<Catalyst::Upgrading> for a full description of how changes in the
framework may affect your application.

Below is a brief list of features which have been deprecated in this release:

=over

=item ::[MVC]:: style naming scheme has been deprecated and will warn

=item NEXT is deprecated for all applications and components, use MRO::Compat

=item Dispatcher methods which are an implementation detail made private, public versions now warn.

=item MyApp->plugin method is deprecated, use L<Catalyst::Model::Adaptor> instead.

=back

=head2 Dispatcher

Fix forwarding to Catalyst::Action objects (Rafael Kitover).

=head2 Restarter

The development server restarter has been improved to be compatible with
immutable Moose classes, and also to optionally use 
L<B::Hooks::OP::Check::StashChange> to handle more complex application layouts
correctly.

=head2 $c->uri_for_action method. (hdp)

A private path to the Catalyst action you want to create a URI for.
This is a shortcut for calling C<< $c->dispatcher->get_action_by_path($path) >>
and passing the resulting C<$action> and the remaining arguments to 
C<< $c->uri_for >>.

=head2 Logging

Log levels have been madeadditive, and add documentation to the setup_log 
method.

=head2 Consequences of the Moose backend

=over

=item *

Use MooseX::MethodAttributes::Inheritable to contain action
attributes. This means that attributes are now represented in the MOP,
allowing method modifiers on actions to work as expected. (rafl)

=item *

Provide a reasonable API in Catalyst::Controller for working with
and registering actions, allowing a controller sub-class to replace
subroutine attributes for action declerations with an alternate
syntax. (rafl/hdp)

=item *

Refactor capturing of $app from Catalyst::Controller into
Catalyst::Component::ApplicationAttribute for easier reuse in other
components (Florian Ragwitz)

=item *

Make MyApp immutable at the end of the scope after the setup
method is called, fixing issues with plugins which have their 
own new methods by inlining a constructor on MyApp (t0m)        

=back

=head2 Test Suite

        - Change Catalyst::Test to use Sub::Exporter (Florian Ragwitz).
        - Port to Moose
        - Support mocking virtualhosts in test suite ()
        - Add methods like action_ok and action_redirect to write
          more compact tests

=head2 Catalyst::Response->print()

Prints @data to the output stream, separated by $,.  This lets you pass
the response object to functions that want to write to an L<IO::Handle>.
