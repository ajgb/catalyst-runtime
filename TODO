  - Fix t/caf_backcompat_plugin_accessor_override.t
  
  - meta-method.diff test for MX::Emulate::CAF needed by 
    Catalyst::Plugin::Cache::Curried

  - Common engine test failures, look into and get tests into core.

  - Catalyst-Plugin-Authorization-ACL, Can't locate object method "tree" 
    via package "Catalyst::Dispatcher", fix the plugin as tree was never 
    a public method.

  - Catalyst-Model-Akismet, incorrectly inherits from 
    Catalyst::Component::InstancePerContext, should compose as a role. 
    Fix the module.

  - CatalystX-Imports, Class::MOP doesn't consider anon subs in the symbol 
    table as methods, tests + fix?

  - Update Test suite to not assume MyApp ISA Controller
    - After that set up attr handlers that will output helpful error messages 
      when you do it as well as how to fix it. (done already?)
  
  - Comments marked /Moose TODO/i in Catalyst::Request re {_body}
  
  - Eliminate all instances of $instance->{$key}, I think the only thing
    left is lib/Catalyst/Engine/HTTP.pm: $self->{inputbuf}, which I haven't
    touched as it is used as an lvalue in a lot of places.

  - Catalyst-Log-Log4perl - deep recursion in the test suite, investigate. 

  - Profiling vs 5.70 and optimisation as needed.

  - http://lists.scsys.co.uk/pipermail/catalyst-dev/2008-November/001546.html
    - patch to list, andyg to look at?

  - Fix the Roadmap to be less full of lies.
  
  - Run another round of repository smokes against latest 5.80 trunk, manually
    go through all the things which are broken.
