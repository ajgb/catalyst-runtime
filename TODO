  - Fix t/caf_backcompat_plugin_accessor_override.t
  
  - Looks like stash is not available during prepare_path when running under
    Catalyst::Test.. Run MojoMojo's t/01app.t and it will explode with
    "Can't use an undefined value as a HASH reference" - test case for core
    + fix maybe (marcus)

  - Common engine test failures, look into and get tests into core.

  - Catalyst-Plugin-Authorization-ACL, Can't locate object method "tree" via package "Catalyst::Dispatcher", fix the plugin as tree was never a public method.

  - Catalyst-Model-Akismet, incorrectly inherits from Catalyst::Component::InstancePerContext, should compose as a role, fix the module.

  - CatalystX-Imports, Class::MOP doesn't consider anon subs in the symbol table as methods, tests + fix?

  - MooseX::Emulate::Class::Accessor::Fast
    - Tests for uses of C::A::F from Catalyst repos. - t0m
    - New release once these are done.

  - Update Test suite to not assume MyApp ISA Controller
    - After that set up attr handlers that will output helpful error messages when you do it as well as how to fix it. (done already?)
  
  - Comments marked /Moose TODO/i in the code
  
  - Eliminate all instances of $instance->{$key}

  - Catalyst-Log-Log4perl - deep recursion in the test suite, investigate

  - Profiling vs 5.70 and optimisation as needed.

  - http://lists.scsys.co.uk/pipermail/catalyst-dev/2008-November/001546.html
    - patch to list, andyg to look at?
