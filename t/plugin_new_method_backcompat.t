# Test that plugins with their own new method don't break applications.

# 5.70 creates all of the request/response structure itself in prepare,
# and as the new method in our plugin just blesses our args, that works nicely.

# In 5.80, we rely on the new method to appropriately initialise data
# structures, and therefore we need to inline a new method on MyApp to ensure
# that plugins don't get it wrong for us.

# Also tests method modifiers and etc in MyApp.pm still work as expected.
